# bestool

All-in-one tool for BES ops and dev tasks.

This is the successor to the "Ops Tooling" scripts.

It manifests as a single binary that can be easily uploaded to Windows machines, or downloaded from the internet, and can also work cross-platform on Linux and Mac for many tasks.

See `bestool <subcommand> --help` for extensive help.
