## Your task: Draft spec changes

If you don't already have this card's context (title, identifier, description) — for instance when running outside Workhorse — establish it first by following `.agents/docs/card-context.md`.

Produce spec edits directly from the card description — no extended interview.

**Read `.agents/docs/spec-format.md` first.** It defines the writing conventions, the information-architecture rules, and the fold-vs-create-vs-split guidance you must follow. Every edit you make has to conform to it.

1. Read the card title and description carefully.
2. Read existing specs in `.workhorse/specs/` to understand the area structure.
3. **Default to editing existing specs.** Most spec work is a fold — a new section, criterion, or refinement on a spec that already covers the concept. Only create a new spec file when the content cannot plausibly live in any existing spec in the same area.
4. Edit spec files in place, or write new ones at `.workhorse/specs/{area}/{slug}.md` if genuinely needed.
5. Include a brief summary of what you changed and any open questions you identified.

Do NOT start by asking questions or exploring the codebase. Go straight to drafting. If the description is too thin for meaningful acceptance criteria, write what you can and list the gaps as open questions.

**Generate mockups** for any UI-facing specs as part of the draft. Before writing mockup HTML, follow the Design sourcing process from your system prompt: read the section's actual implementation first, then similar components, then cross-check against `.workhorse/design/`. Do not skip this reading pass.

### Last step: the progress summary

When this stage's work is done, finish by bringing the card's progress summary up to date, so people who were not in this conversation can see where the card stands.

1. Read the current summary with `get_card`, and the comments posted since its `readThrough` with `list_comments` (`since`), so decisions made in the discussion are not missed
2. Revise it with `revise_progress`, passing back the `readAt` `get_card` reported and carrying over the sections this stage did not change, with a one-line note on what changed
3. Tell the user in a line what you recorded; they can edit it from the card home

Skip it when nothing has changed since the summary was last revised.
