- For tests requiring database connections, use `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost/tamanu_meta` as the connection string.
- When adding or changing features, or when fixing bugs, add tests whenever possible.
- Never write documentation files or readmes.
- Always run `cargo clippy` and `cargo fmt` before committing changes.
- Use conventional commit messages.
- Never write useless comments that only repeat the code.
- Never print summaries or unnecessary information.
- Don't use emojis in text or commit messages unless absolutely necessary.
- When removing code that has already been committed, delete it unless explicitly requested that it be commented out.
- Prefer using small dependencies instead of reimplementing the wheel. Ask the user to pick a dependency if there is no obvious choice.
- Use `--no-pager` with `git log`, `git diff`, etc commands.
- Imports: merge them and group them by std, then third-party/workspace, then local (crate, super, self).
